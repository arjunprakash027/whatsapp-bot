# How I am using this bot exactly

This bot is designed to automate the process of finding suitable house lettings in Dublin from various WhatsApp groups.

The primary purpose of this bot is to:

1.  **Monitor WhatsApp Groups:** The bot (my own phone number) is added to several WhatsApp groups where house letting advertisements are posted.
2.  **Filter and Store Messages:** It actively listens for new messages in these groups and saves them to a database. It can be configured to only monitor specific, whitelisted groups.
3.  **AI-Powered Analysis:** The bot uses an AI model to analyze the content of the saved messages. The AI identifes key details in the letting ads and determine if a property is a "good bet" based on predefined criteria.
4.  **Automated Responses:** If the AI determines that a letting is a good match, the bot will automatically send a message back to the original poster or group, expressing interest or requesting more information.

This automated process saves a significant amount of time and effort that would otherwise be spent manually sifting through countless messages and allows for a much faster response to promising letting opportunities.
